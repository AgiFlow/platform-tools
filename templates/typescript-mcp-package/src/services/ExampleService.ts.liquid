/**
 * {{ serviceName }}
 * 
 * DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * - Service pattern for business logic encapsulation
 * - Single responsibility principle
 * 
 * CODING STANDARDS:
 * - Use async/await for asynchronous operations
 * - Throw descriptive errors for error cases
 * - Keep methods focused and well-named
 * - Document complex logic with comments
 * 
 * AVOID:
 * - Mixing concerns (keep focused on single domain)
 * - Direct tool implementation (services should be tool-agnostic)
