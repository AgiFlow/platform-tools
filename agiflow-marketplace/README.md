## Quick Start

### 1. Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### 2. Configure Agiflow MCP Server

#### Option A: Get Configuration from Agiflow (Recommended)

1. **Sign up at [https://agiflow.io](https://agiflow.io)**
2. **Create a new project** in the Agiflow dashboard
3. **Follow the setup wizard** to generate your MCP configuration
   - The wizard will provide you with a ready-to-use `.mcp.json` configuration
   - Configuration includes your project-specific endpoint and API key
   - Agiflow provides HTTP MCP servers hosted at `https://agiflow.io`

4. **Copy the configuration** to your project's `.mcp.json` file

**Example configuration from Agiflow:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agiflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@agiflowai/powertool", "mcp-serve"],
      "env": {
        "AGIFLOW_MCP_PROXY_ENDPOINT": "https://agiflow.io/api/v1/projects/your-project-id/mcp/config",
        "AGIFLOW_MCP_API_KEY": "your-generated-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Interactive Authentication (Alternative)

Simply run the command without configuration, and `@agiflowai/powertool` will guide you through authentication:

```bash
npx @agiflowai/powertool mcp-serve
```

The CLI will:
1. Prompt you to visit https://agiflow.io/auth
2. Ask you to copy your endpoint URL and API key
3. Save credentials locally for future use

Then add to your `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agiflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@agiflowai/powertool", "mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option C: Local Development

For contributors developing the powertool package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agiflow-proxy": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["./packages/powertool/src/cli.ts", "mcp-serve", "--config-file", "./mcp-proxy-config.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Install from GitHub (Production)

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agiflow/claude-code-marketplace

# Install plugin
/plugin install agiflow@agiflow-marketplace

# Restart Claude Code
```

### 4. Install from Local Directory (Development)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/agiflow/claude-code-marketplace.git

# Start Claude Code
claude

# Add local marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ./path/to/agiflow-marketplace

# Install plugin

## Usage

### Available Commands

#### `/agiflow-plan` - Planning Projects

Convert requirements into structured tasks and work units.

```bash
/agiflow-plan
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze your project context
2. Break down requirements into 5-15 focused tasks
3. Assign tasks to appropriate agents
4. Group related tasks into work units (3-8 tasks per unit)
5. Create everything in Agiflow with acceptance criteria

**Example:**
```
You: /agiflow-plan Add shopping cart functionality with checkout

Claude:
- Analyzing project context...
- Creating 6 tasks...
- Creating work unit "Shopping Cart Feature"...
- Associating tasks with work unit...

Created:
✓ Work Unit: Shopping Cart Feature (6 tasks, ~3 hours)
  - Task 1: Implement add-to-cart API (nodejs-hono-api-developer)
  - Task 2: Implement remove-from-cart API (nodejs-hono-api-developer)
  - Task 3: Implement get-cart API (nodejs-hono-api-developer)
  - Task 4: Create cart UI component (spa-frontend-developer)

```

#### `/agiflow-task` - Implementing Tasks

Execute a single task from your backlog with automatic tracking.

```bash
/agiflow-task [task-id]
```

Claude will:
1. List available Todo tasks (or use provided task-id)
2. Move task to "In Progress"
3. Check design patterns with Architect MCP (MANDATORY)
4. Implement each acceptance criterion
5. Update devInfo with progress tracking
6. Validate code changes with Architect MCP (MANDATORY)
7. Move task to "Review" when complete

**Example:**
```
You: /agiflow-task

Claude:
Available Tasks:
1. Implement add-to-cart API (high priority)

```

#### `/agiflow-work` - Executing Work Units

Execute a complete work unit (feature/epic) with multiple tasks.

```bash
/agiflow-work [work-unit-slug-or-id]
```

Claude will:
1. Get work unit with all associated tasks
2. Set work unit status to "in_progress"
3. Create TODO list of tasks in execution order
4. Execute each task sequentially with full validation
5. Update work unit progress in devInfo
6. Run tests between tasks
7. Complete work unit when all tasks done

**Example:**
```
You: /agiflow-work shopping-cart-feature

Claude:
Work Unit: Shopping Cart Feature (6 tasks)

```bash
/agiflow-complete [task-id]
```

Claude will:
1. Verify all acceptance criteria are checked
2. Verify task status is "Review"
3. Run final validations (typecheck, test, lint)
4. Add completion summary comment
5. Move task to "Done"

**Example:**
```
You: /agiflow-complete task-123

Claude:
Reviewing task: Implement add-to-cart API

✓ All acceptance criteria checked (4/4)
✓ Task status is "Review"

Running validations:
✓ TypeScript compilation passed
✓ All tests passed (coverage: 87%)
