/**
 * Constants Barrel Export
 *
 * DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * - Single entry point for all constants
 * - Re-export pattern for clean imports
 * - Organized by domain/category
 *
 * CODING STANDARDS:
 * - Export all constants from subdomain files
 * - Use wildcard exports: export * from './file.constants'
 * - Keep alphabetically sorted for maintainability
 * - Add JSDoc for complex constant groups
 *
 * AVOID:
 * - Selective re-exports (export only what's needed publicly)
 * - Mixing constants with other exports
 * - Deep nesting - keep flat structure
