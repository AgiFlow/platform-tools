/**
 * {{ packageName }} - Main Entry Point
 *
 * DESIGN PATTERNS:
 * - Barrel export pattern: Re-export all public APIs from submodules
 * - Single entry point: All library consumers import from this file
 *
 * CODING STANDARDS:
 * - Export only stable, public APIs
 * - Use named exports (avoid default exports)
 * - Group exports by feature/domain
 *
 * AVOID:
 * - Exporting internal implementation details
 * - Circular dependencies between modules
 * - Side effects at module initialization
